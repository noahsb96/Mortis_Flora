      When I was a kid, I always found myself collecting assortments of shells and feathers or
      “trash treasures”, as my mother used to call them. This passion bled into my academic days,
      where I longed for a degree in Zoology to further foster my interest in the spectacle that is
      fauna biodiversity. After that great adventure was completed and satisfied, I spent a few
      years as a horticulturist and florist for a few small companies. It goes without saying that
      plants and animals both perish at the end of their allotted lifespans, but I never understood
      why the story has to end there.

      With my newfound education equipped, (I have a big fancy degree that means I can tell you the
      difference between a lion and a camel skull, and as an added bonus, I know what a petunia is!)
      I began to dust off those old trash treasures and find better ways of displaying them,
      combining pieces together behind geometric glass displays so that I could enjoy their presence
      in a more “adult” fashion.

      With an unwavering passion for both artistry and conservation, my creations stand as exquisite
      tributes to the splendor of nature and the elegance of design. Inspired by the timeless allure
      of museum dioramas, each piece is meticulously crafted to ignite the imagination. Embracing
      ethical stewardship, I meticulously source materials from sustainable and respectful origins,
      ensuring that every creation resonates with a profound reverence for the natural world.
